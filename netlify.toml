  # Note: The above redirect is typically for SPAs. 
  # Since this is an MPA, we mostly rely on direct file matching.
  # However, for clean URLs (e.g. /product instead of /product.html), Netlify handles .html automatically.
  # We can add a catch-all if we want 404s to go somewhere custom, or just rely on default behavior.
  # For now, standard build settings are sufficient.
